for binaries built from latest commits -> https://drone.io/github.com/xriss/gamecake/files


Be sure to clone repo with submodules as the engine binaries live in a 
permanently orphaned branch.

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/xriss/gamecake.git

The same also needs to be done when you pull updates, so best to use 
this script.

	./git-pull


Autogenerated lua code documentation can be found at 
https://xriss.github.io/gamecake/ but not everything is fully 
documented here yet.

Releases are built using the vbox_* directories which contain 
vagrant/qemu boxes setup to build the code in a controlled environment. 
Running the ./make script will setup everything and then build it. The 
latest code built this way can be found in the exe branch, a zip of 
them all can be downloaded from 
https://github.com/xriss/gamecake/archive/exe.zip

For a linuxy build, the required lib dependencies are luajit and SDL2. 
Install these then you may use the following scripts to 
make and install.

	./make
	sudo ./install


Once built the engine lives in one single fat binary that includes many 
lua libraries. For convenience gamecake is a command line compatible 
replacement for lua and pagecake is a command line compatible 
replacement for nginx (open resty). The only diference is we have C 
libraries and Lua libraries from this repository embeded ready to be 
required in you lua script.
